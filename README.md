# Rap Machine
 The Rap Machine is a product of machine learning that utilizes spaCy, an open-source NLP library, as well as a recurrent neural network architecture called LSTM in order to generate [lyrics](https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics) from a Kaggle dataset containing more than 55,000 lyrics across several genres. The second part of this project involves predicting which artist would most likely be associated in terms of style with the machine-generated lyrics. 
 
## Getting Started
-You will need access to Jupyter Notebook in order to run through the code yourself. Feel free to mess around and see what you can create! Using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics), as well as downloading Jupyter Notebook from [here](http://jupyter.org/install.html), you can do a lot with this code. 

-You will also need to install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [Keras](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/11/14/installing-keras-with-tensorflow-backend/), as well as have NumPy and Pandas (two popular Python libraries) [installed](http://viziblr.com/news/2012/4/21/step-by-step-installing-pandas-on-windows-7-from-pypi-with-e.html) on your machine. Of course, you can use simple pip commands to install these libraries as well.

*Warning - Some of the source code (especially training the model in the end) may contain vulgar language - this is due to the lyrical contents of the artists.*
