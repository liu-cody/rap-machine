    "   #### What is this?\n",
    "    - The Rap Machine is a Recurrent Neural Network (specifically an LSTM) implemented using the Python libraries spaCy, keras, and numpy. Its purpose is to generate original rap lyrics after being trained on lyrics from a Kaggle dataset. The second part of this project involves using another LSTM to attempt to learn the style of several artists and, given a new song, predict which artist its style most closely resembles."
